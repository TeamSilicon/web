# Creating a new workshop

Thanks for deciding to help us out and create a new workshop! What you will want to do is go in to the `/workshops` directory and create a new `.md` file. You can name it however you like! In your `.md` file, it should contain all the materials/programs one should need and how to get/install them. It should contain the instructions and don't forget to give yourself some credit! Put your name! (or you can be anonymous if you want)

Then, head over to `workshops.html` and add a boostrap.css card:
```
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Special title treatment</h5>
    <p class="card-text">With supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```
in the `card-container` div.

Fill out the information with a breif description of the project, name of the project, and the hyperlink to it from the button. You can also put your own name in the title!
